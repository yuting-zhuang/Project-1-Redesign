For the manifesto project redesign, I kept the original two-column design (h2 on the left, body text on the right), and added more visual elements that match the reading response.

The article is about the dilemma of designers. Designers' creativity is "trapped" in a range dominated by market forces. So here I used an animation to let the border “trap” the text "that's entertainment". Then I used the hover state to "release" the creativity.

When designers brainstorm, it is a stage of creative explosion. At this stage, designers usually sketch on paper, so I used handwritten fonts. But to ensure readability, the body text is in “roboto”.
